## Predicting Loan Defaults
### Data Analysis Project: [Loan Defaulter Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/loan-defaulter)
Can we predict whether a customer will likely default on a loan given their application information? This project aims to analyze different bahaviors of clients as well as aspects of their loan application. Using this, our goal is to be able to predict whether a client will end up defaulting on the loan they are applying to where the threshold for defaulting (i.e. number of days late a payment is) is dependent on the type of loan requested. This is a very useful business problem to solve for many financial institutions like banks, credit unions, etc. and can be extended to other applications such as insurance companies when deciding whether to take on a client or not.
